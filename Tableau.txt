Please find the team's tableau here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michal.michael/viz/Finance_project_16468574032900/ModelScores?publish=yes

Please find a detailed list of the charts available below:
1. NYA V NASDAQ High Low Chart - comparison between NYA and NASDAQ average high and average low per year 
2. NYA and NASDAQ Volume - a liine chart showing the increasing volume that people are purchasing (could show importance of being able to predict)
3. NYA Random Forest Actual Movement - Bar chart of the actual Up V Down for the Random Forest model
4. NYA Random Forest Predicted Movement - Bar chart of the Predicted Up V Down for the Random Forest model
5. NYA SMOTE Actual Movement - Bar chart of the actual Up V Down for the Random Forest model after SMOTE resampling
6. NYA SMOTE Predicted Movement - Bar chart of the Predicted Up V Down for the Random Forest model after SMOTE resampling
7. NYA Undersampling Actual Movement - Bar chart of the actual Up V Down for the Random Forest model after undersampling resampling
8. NYA Undersampling Predicted Movement - Bar chart of the Predicted Up V Down for the Random Forest model after undersampling resampling
9. Model Scores - side by side circle charts showing the precision, sccuracy, and f1 score for each machine learning model given the index went up/down/overall

Open Questions:
Can we combine the bar charts?
Can we compare NYA V NASDAQ?
