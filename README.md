# Final_project

## Project Overview
- Selected topic: Predicting Whether Stock Exchange Prices will Close Higher or Lower than They Open
- Reason why they selected their topic: We believe that the price of the stock exchange is an indicator of general financial stability which is crucial to people's decision-making. We would like to try and predict stock exchange prices to hopefully understand the level of financial stability. In this project, we will be focusing specifically on the ^NYA, the stock market index covering all common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
- Description of their source of data: we are using a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mattiuzc/stock-exchange-data) that has daily price data for indexes tracking stock exchanges from all over the world (United States, China, Canada, Germany, Japan, and more). The data was all collected from Yahoo Finance, which had several decades of data available for most exchanges. We will be focusing on 2 CSV files:
    1. A CSV with stock exchange data inclusing the columns: Stock Exchange Index, Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume
    2. A reference CSV with columns: Region, Exchange, Index, Currency
- Questions they hope to answer with the data: Based on the opening price of a particular index, will the closing price be higher or lower?

## Communication Protocols
Our main plan is to touch base through slack as that has been an active and funcitonal method thus far. If a team member is unreachable through slack, we have shared our emails as a secondary line of communication.
